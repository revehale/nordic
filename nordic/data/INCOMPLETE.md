# Incomplete



The main dictionary in combined.md is a scanned version of the *Norsk-Engelsk Stor Ordbok* (2002) which does not appear to be in print any longer. The introduction to the work says there are 94,000 terms and 203,000 translations. It appears to be larger than either the dictionary which comes installed on Apple devices, or the two directional *Engelsk blå ordbok* (2011)

The sentences in sentences.tsv comes from the CC BY 2.0 FR licensed sentences on Tatoeba.org. Last Updated: 2025.2.16

The raw data for this tool (in nordic/data/combined.md) is NOT checked for errors yet.

The data was OCRed from images by and LLM and the data is being manually checked. 

As for this version, the following letters have been proofread and corrected:

å 5pp DONE
y 4pp DONE
æ 3pp DONE
w 2pp DONE
z 1p DONE
q 1pp DONE
x 1p DONE
c 4pp DONE
ø 7pp DONE

When checking we are looking for:

- missing data on top of pages, or top of columns not handled by the LLM properly
- "se ⏵" 
- handling of superscript numbers
- making sure su-entries are recognized as subentries
- Note: we haven't been checking the full accuracy of OCR in the definitions and sentences but spot checks suggest these are not too common.
